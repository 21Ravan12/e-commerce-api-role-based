# router.md

This file defines routes for **admin-level operations** in a support/ticketing system. The routes are grouped into three main sections: **Category Management**, **Knowledge Base Administration**, and **Ticket Management**. Each section maps HTTP endpoints to specific controller methods, enabling backend functionality for managing categories, articles, and support tickets.

## üìÅ Category Routes (`categoryController`)

These endpoints allow for managing help center or support categories, which likely group tickets or knowledge base articles.

### `POST /category/add`
- Adds a new category.
- Expected input: category name, description, or other metadata in the request body.

### `PUT /category/update/:id`
- Updates an existing category based on the `:id` parameter.
- Request body should include updated fields.

### `DELETE /category/delete/:id`
- Deletes the specified category by its ID.
- Used for administrative clean-up or restructuring.

This section provides powerful tools for maintaining and cleaning up the knowledge base system used in customer support.

### `DELETE /knowledge-base/bulk-delete`
