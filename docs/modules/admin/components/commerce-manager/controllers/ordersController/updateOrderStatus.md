# updateOrderStatus.md

This function `updateOrderStatus(req, res)` is a secure and robust **admin-only API endpoint** designed to update the status or related fields of an order. It includes comprehensive **logging**, **authorization**, **validation**, **audit trail**, and optional **refund processing**.

---

## 🪵 Admin Action Logging (Start)
```js
const { logEntry, complete } = await AdminLog.createTimedAdminLog(...)
````

* A timed admin log is initialized to track this action (`update_order_status`) from start to finish.
* Captures:

  * Who performed the action (`req.user._id`)
  * What was targeted (`Order` model and specific ID)
  * IP and User-Agent
  * Request body details

---

## 🔐 Authorization

```js
if (req.user.role !== 'admin') { ... }
```

* Only users with the `'admin'` role are allowed to update order status.
* If unauthorized, the request is logged and terminated with `403 Forbidden`.

---

## ✅ Validation Steps

1. **Order ID Format**

   * Checks if `req.params.id` is a valid MongoDB ObjectId.

2. **Body Schema**

   * Validates request body using `updateAdminOrderSchema` (likely a Joi schema).
   * Returns `400 Bad Request` on validation failure with detailed field errors.

---

## 🔍 Order Lookup

```js
const order = await Order.findById(orderId);
```

* Ensures the order exists before attempting an update.
* If not found, returns `404 Not Found`.

---

## 🧾 Change Snapshot (Audit)

```js
const oldValues = { ... };
```

* Captures current values before making updates (for comparison/audit purposes):

  * `status`, `paymentStatus`, `shippingAddress`, etc.

---

## 🔄 Status Transition Rules

```js
if (req.body.status && !req.body.forceUpdate) { ... }
```

* Applies a whitelist of valid status transitions unless `forceUpdate = true` is specified.
* Prevents invalid state changes like jumping from `pending → delivered`.
* Returns helpful error with `solution: 'Set forceUpdate=true to override'`.

---

## 💸 Refund Handling

```js
if (req.body.status === 'refunded') { ... }
```

* If admin sets status to `'refunded'`, the `PaymentService.processRefund()` is called.
* On refund failure:

  * Admin log and audit log record the error.
  * Returns `402 Payment Required`.

---

## 🛠️ Updating the Order

```js
Object.assign(order, req.body);
order.updatedBy = adminId;
order.adminNotes = req.body.adminNotes || order.adminNotes;
```

* Applies changes from request body.
* Tracks admin ID responsible for update.
* Updates internal fields like `adminNotes`.

---

## 💾 Save + Log Success

```js
const updatedOrder = await order.save();
await complete({ status: 'success', details: { ... } });
await AuditLog.createLog({ event: 'ADMIN_ORDER_UPDATE', ... });
```

* Saves updated order.
* Marks the original admin log as successful with both old and new values.
* Creates a specialized audit log event with metadata for further traceability.

---

## 📦 Response Formatting

```js
res.status(200).json({ message: 'Order updated successfully by admin', ... });
```

* Returns a clean, front-end friendly order object.
* Includes refund info if processed.

---

## ❌ Error Handling

```js
} catch (error) { ... }
```

* On unexpected exceptions:

  * Admin log is marked as `failed`.
  * Detailed audit log is created with stack traces (in development).
  * Response returns `500 Internal Server Error`.
