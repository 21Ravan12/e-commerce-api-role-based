# findByOrder.md

This function, `findByOrder`, is an asynchronous Express.js route handler designed to **retrieve a payment record associated with a specific order ID**. It includes detailed logging, error handling, and security-conscious HTTP headers.

---

## üîç Function Purpose
- Search for a payment linked to a given `orderId` passed as a URL parameter (`req.params.orderId`).
- Return the payment data with related resource links if found.
- Log the entire process for audit and troubleshooting.

## üìù Detailed Workflow

1. **Timed Admin Log Creation**  
   - Creates a timed log entry (`AdminLog.createTimedAdminLog`) capturing metadata:
     - Action: `"find_payment_by_order"`
     - Target model: `"Payment"`
     - User performing the action (ID and email)
     - Client IP and user-agent
     - Request headers relevant to content type and accept
     - Order ID being queried  
   - The function receives `logEntry` (initial log record) and `complete` (a callback to finalize the log).

2. **Logging Incoming Request**  
   - Logs informational message with the order ID and client IP.

3. **Payment Lookup**  
   - Calls `Payment.findByOrder` with the `orderId` to find the payment record.
   - If no payment is found:
     - Completes the log with status `"failed"` including details about the missing payment.
     - Responds with HTTP 404 and JSON error message indicating payment not found.

4. **Successful Response Preparation**  
   - Builds a response object containing:
     - `success: true`
     - `payment` data spread with added `links` for:
       - The payment resource itself (`/payment/get/:paymentId`)
       - The associated order resource (`/order/get/:orderId`)
   - Completes the log with status `"success"`, including key payment details and response links.

5. **Response Headers & JSON Reply**  
   - Sets security headers to mitigate MIME sniffing (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`) and clickjacking (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`).
   - Sends HTTP 200 with the response JSON.

6. **Error Handling**  
   - If any error occurs during processing:
     - Completes the log with `"failed"` status including error message, stack (only in development), order ID, and error type.
     - Logs the error with stack trace and order ID.
     - Sends HTTP 500 response with a generic error message.
     - Includes detailed error info in the response only if running in development mode.

## üîê Security & Best Practices
- Logs all actions with user and request context for accountability.
- Uses HTTP headers to enhance response security.
- Separates error handling clearly, returning minimal info in production.
- Validates existence of payment before responding to prevent null references.
