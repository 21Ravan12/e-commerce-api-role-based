# getPayments.md

This function `getPayments` handles an authenticated API request to fetch paginated and filtered payment records, with detailed logging, error handling, and security headers.

---

## üïí Timed Admin Logging

- At the start, it creates a **timed admin log entry** via `AdminLog.createTimedAdminLog` to track this action (`get_payments`).
- Logs include:
  - Action name, target model (`Payment`),
  - Requesting user ID and email,
  - IP address and user-agent header,
  - Source (`web`),
  - Redacted query parameters,
  - Customer ID and admin role flag.
- `logEntry` marks the start; `complete()` finalizes the log after success or failure.

---

## üìù Query Parameter Extraction & Sanitization

- Extracts query parameters from `req.query` with default values:
  - Pagination: `page` (default 1), `limit` (default 10)
  - Filters: `payment_status`, `payment_method`, `currency`, `min_amount`, `max_amount`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `search`
  - Sorting: `sortBy` (default `payment_date`), `sortOrder` (default `desc`)
- Creates a sanitized copy of query parameters for logging, redacting sensitive values like amounts and search strings.

---

## üîç Payment Retrieval

- Calls a separate `getPayments` function passing:
  - The `Payment` model,
  - Customer ID (`req.user._id`),
  - Parsed pagination values,
  - Filter options from query,
  - Sorting options.
- Receives a `response` object containing paginated payment data, total counts, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ Successful Response Handling

- Completes the admin log with status `'success'` and detailed info:
  - Final pagination info (current page, limit, total results, total pages),
  - Count of returned records,
  - Applied (redacted) filters,
  - Sorting details.
- Sets HTTP security headers:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- Sets rate-limit headers to inform client of usage.
- Responds with HTTP 200 and JSON payload containing payment data.

---

## ‚ùå Error Handling

- On error, prepares an error details object including:
  - Error message and stack trace (in development),
  - Redacted query parameters,
  - Customer ID and IP,
  - Error type.
- If the error is a validation error, it adds specific validation messages.
- Completes the admin log with status `'failed'` and error details.
- Responds with:
  - HTTP 400 for validation errors with a clear "Validation error" message,
  - HTTP 500 for other errors with "Internal server error" message,
  - Includes error message and optionally error details and system error info in dev mode.

---

## Summary

This method ensures:

- Secure, paginated, and filtered retrieval of payment records,
- Comprehensive audit logging for admin actions with start/end timing,
- Sensitive data redaction in logs,
- Appropriate HTTP headers for security and rate limiting,
- Clear client feedback on errors with proper HTTP status codes.
