## Detailed Breakdown

1. **Logging the Request**
   - Logs an info message with the target product ID and the IP address of the requester for traceability.

2. **Extracting Parameters**

   * Retrieves the `productId` from URL parameters.
   * Extracts `commentText` and `rating` from the request body.
   * Extracts the authenticated user info from `req.user`.

     * Event type (`comment_added`)
     * Action (`create`)

     * User ID, IP address, and User-Agent header for security tracking
