# getCategory.md

This function `getCategory` is an **asynchronous controller method** designed to handle HTTP requests for retrieving a specific category by its ID. It includes validation, logging, auditing, and error handling to ensure robust operation.

---

## Function Workflow

### 1. Logging Request Start
- Logs an informational message including the requested category ID and the client IP address using a `logger` service.
- Example log:  
  `Get category request for ID: <categoryId> from IP: <clientIP>`

### 2. Validate Category ID
- Uses `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid` to confirm if `req.params.id` is a valid MongoDB ObjectId.
- If invalid, throws an error: `'Invalid category ID'`.

### 3. Retrieve Category
- Calls an asynchronous `getCategory` function with the validated ID to fetch the category data from the database or service.
- Awaits the result to ensure proper flow.

### 4. Audit Logging
- After successful retrieval, creates an audit log entry using `AuditLog.createLog()` with details:
  - `action`: Identifier for the action performed (`knowledge_base_get_category`).
  - `event`: Type of event (`get_category`).
  - `source`: Who initiated the action (`moderator`).
  - `targetModel`: The model affected (`Category`).
  - `targetId`: The ID of the category accessed.
  - `performedBy`: The current authenticated user's ID (`req.user?._id`), if available.
  - `ip`: Client IP address.
  - `userAgent`: Client User-Agent header for tracking the client device/browser.

### 5. Respond to Client
- Sends a successful JSON response (`HTTP 200`) including:
  - `data`: The retrieved category object.
  - `timestamp`: Current ISO timestamp of the response.

### 6. Error Handling
- Catches any errors during the process.
- Calls `this.handleError(res, error)` to send an appropriate error response (implementation of `handleError` assumed elsewhere).

## Summary
- Validates input ID strictly to prevent invalid queries.
- Ensures all requests and responses are logged for traceability.
- Audits every category fetch operation for security and compliance.
- Provides clear success or error responses in JSON format.

## ðŸ“¥ Request Body Example (JSON)

This endpoint does not require a request body because it retrieves a category by ID via URL parameter.
